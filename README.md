# StockHawk
Added enhancements to the app in order to make it production ready. The work included ensuring errors were handled gracefully, building a widget for the home screen, adding support for screen readers, optimizations for localization, and data visualization via a library. 

Tools and concepts used:-

 - Retrofit with cleansing response JSON before parsing it with GSON. 
 - Yahoo Charts API to source historical data
 - Widgets and PendingIntents
 - MPAndroidChart API
