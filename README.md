# StockHawk
Added enhancements to the app in order to make it production ready. The work included ensuring errors were handled gracefully, building a widget for the home screen, adding support for screen readers, optimizations for localization, and data visualization via a library. 

Tools and concepts used:-

1) Retrofit with cleansing response JSON before parsing it with GSON.
2) Yahoo Charts API to source historical data
3) Widgets and PendingIntents
4) MPAndroidChart API
